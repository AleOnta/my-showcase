# My-Showcase Project: Web3 CV Viewer

## Introduction

Welcome to My-Showcase project! This GitHub repository serves as a platform for visitors to view my Curriculum Vitae (CV) and professional figure interactively. Unlike a conventional portfolio, this project focuses on providing a comprehensive CV viewer that also integrates web3 web development principles.

## Project Overview

The Web3 CV Viewer project encompasses the following key features:

1. **CV Viewer**: The primary purpose of this project is to allow visitors to explore my CV and gain insights into my professional journey. The CV viewer presents your personal data, work experiences, education, and contact information.

2. **Web3 Integration**: This project marks my initial foray into web3 web development. To enhance user experience and security, visitors can log in to the web application using their MetaMask account â€” a popular web3 wallet.

3. **Private Area**: Upon successful login with MetaMask, visitors gain access to a private area of the web application. In this section, they can explore additional features related to their MetaMask account.

4. **MetaMask Account Information**: In the private area, visitors can view crucial details about their MetaMask account, such as their wallet address, balance, and the chain ID they are connected to.

5. **Data Manipulation**: Visitors can experiment with and manipulate certain aspects of my CV within the private area. This includes making changes to my personal data, contact information, educational history, and work experiences.

6. **Session Storage Implementation**: To facilitate experimentation and testing without permanently altering my CV data, the project leverages the browser's Session Storage. This way, visitors can simulate API calls for POST, PUT, and DELETE operations on their session data, knowing that their changes won't affect the actual stored data.

## Technologies Used

The Web3 CV Viewer project is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **React**: The web application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to add static typing to the project, providing better code readability and improved development experience.

- **React-Bootstrap v2.8.0**: This library is used for styling and designing components, ensuring a consistent and responsive user interface.

- **Framer Motion v10.13.0**: Framer Motion is utilized to add smooth and fluid animations to enhance user interactions.

- **EmailJS v3.11.0**: EmailJS facilitates the process of sending emails directly from the web application, simplifying contact form functionality.

- **MetaMask v2.0.0**: The MetaMask library is integrated into the project to enable seamless web3 wallet authentication for users.

- **React-Datepicker v4.16.0**: This library provides a user-friendly date picker for capturing date-related information in the CV.

- **React-DOM v18.2.0**: React-DOM is responsible for rendering React components into the HTML document.

- **React-Icons v4.10.1**: This library offers a wide range of icons to use throughout the web application.

- **React-Router-DOM v6.14.2**: React-Router-DOM is used for handling navigation and routing within the web application.

- **React-Scripts v5.0.1**: React-Scripts provides a set of scripts and configuration for running the development and production build.

- **Sass v1.64.0**: Sass is used as a preprocessor to write more maintainable and organized CSS code.
